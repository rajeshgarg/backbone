    <p>The Depot sample application requires the MySQL database server.</p>
    <h3>Creating the Sample Databases</h3>
    <p>Before you can run this project, you must create at a minimum
      the depot_development database, as described below. You can
    also create the test and production databases if desired.</p>
    <p><b>To Create the Depot Databases:</b>
    </p><ol>
      <li>Open a command window.<br><br></li>
      <li>If it has not already been started, start the MySQL database server.<br><br></li>
      <li>Type the following command to create the development database
        and press Enter.
        <pre>mysqladmin -u root -p create depot_development</pre>
        <b>Note:</b> If the root user does not have a required password,
        omit the <b>-p</b> argument.
        <br><br>
      </li>
      <li>(Optional) Repeat the command to create the <b>depot_test</b> and
        <b>depot_production</b> databases.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Configuring The Database Environment</h3>
    <p>The <tt>database.yml</tt> file is already configured to use the MySQL
      adapter and the three depot databases. You do not need to do
      any configurations unless the root user requires a password.
    </p>
    <p><b>To Specify the Password for the Root User:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the <b>Projects</b> window, expand the <b>Configuration</b> node.<br><br></li>
      <li>Double-click the <b>database.yml</b> node to open the file in the editor.<br><br></li>
      <li>In each of the three configurations (development, test,
        and production), provide the <b>password</b>.
      <br><br></li>
      <li><b>Close</b> and <b>save</b> the file.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Creating the Database Tables</h3>
    <p>This sample project contains the schema migrations
    for creating and seeding the database tables.</p>
    <p><b>To Create the Depot Tables:</b>
    </p><ul>
      <li>In the Projects window, right-click the <b>Depot Application</b> project
        node and choose <b>Migrate Database &gt; To Current Version</b> from the
        pop-up menu.
    </li></ul>
    <h3>Running the Application</h3>
    <p>You are now ready to run the Depot application.</p>
    <p><b>To Run the Depot Application:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the <b>Projects window</b> right-click the <b>Depot Application</b>
        project node and choose Run from the pop-up menu.
      <br><br></li>
